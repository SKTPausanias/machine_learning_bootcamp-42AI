	Args:
	y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
	y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
	theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.

	The regularized cost as a float.
	None if y, y_hat, or theta is empty numpy.ndarray.

	Raises:
	This function should not raise any Exception.
